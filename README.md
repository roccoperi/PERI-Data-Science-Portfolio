# Data Science Portfolio - Rocco Peri
This Portfolio is a compilation of my previous and future Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done/will do for academic and personal purposes. I hope that through the projects presented on this page, my personal interests and passions shine through. Over this semester, I plan on adding to the projects with links to their specific repositories, in which I will use images and code to properly convey the work done throughout my last semester at Notre Dame. 

## Projects

In this project, I utilized the NetHealth Data Set to determine whether racially homophilous relationships decrease or increase over time. Using log-likelihood regressions and variation in basic descriptive summary statistics of networks, I determined that for some races, students at Notre Dame actively maintain and seek out same-race relationships more often than different-race relationships.

In this project, I used sentiment analysis of Reddit posts of certain stock tickers to determine whether the average daily positive and negative sentiment scores of that stock on each day over a year accurately predicted whether the price of the stock increased or decreased. Using RStudio, 3 different sentiment packages, and web scraping with pushshift API, I came to many conclusions regarding the validity of sentiment analysis and where to move forward after this project.

In this project for Portfolio Update 1, I created a Streamlit app in which the user filters a species of penguin from the Palmer Penguins Dataset and the app produces the summary statistics of the species of penguin.

In this project for Portfolio Update 2, I created a Jupyter Notebook, detailing how I used tidy data principless and Pandas functions to clean the 2008 Olympic Medalist dataset and create visualizations that provided insight into the basis of event selection of the Olympics. This project provides a great stepping stone for me in my Data Science journey, as I now understand the methods used and the importance of cleaning data prior to interpretation. I hope I translate what I learned into all future projects.
