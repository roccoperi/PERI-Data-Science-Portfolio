# Data Science Portfolio - Rocco Peri
This Portfolio is a compilation of my previous and future Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done/will do for academic and personal purposes. I hope that through the projects presented on this page, my personal interests and passions shine through. Over this semester, I plan on adding to the projects with links to their specific repositories, in which I will use images and code to properly convey the work done throughout my last semester at Notre Dame. 

## At a Glance
Here, you will find links to all my projects: 
- **[Net Health Project](https://github.com/roccoperi/Net-Health-Project):** Prominence of same-race relationships at Notre Dame

In this project, I utilized the NetHealth Data Set to determine whether racially homophilous relationships decrease or increase over time. Using log-likelihood regressions and variation in basic descriptive summary statistics of networks, I determined that for some races, students at Notre Dame actively maintain and seek out same-race relationships more often than different-race relationships.

In this project, I used sentiment analysis of Reddit posts of certain stock tickers to determine whether the average daily positive and negative sentiment scores of that stock on each day over a year accurately predicted whether the price of the stock increased or decreased. Using RStudio, 3 different sentiment packages, and web scraping with pushshift API, I came to many conclusions regarding the validity of sentiment analysis and where to move forward after this project.

In this project for Portfolio Update 1, I created a Streamlit app in which the user filters a species of penguin from the Palmer Penguins Dataset, and the app produces the summary statistics of the species of penguin. This project provided invaluable knowledge in Streamlit, an application that makes communicating data not only effective, but pleasant to read through.

In this project for Portfolio Update 2, I created a Jupyter Notebook, detailing how I used tidy data principles and Pandas functions to clean the 2008 Olympic Medalist dataset and create visualizations that provided insight into the basis of event selection of the Olympics. This project provides a great stepping stone for me in my Data Science journey, as I now understand the methods used and the importance of cleaning data before interpretation.

In this project for Portfolio Update 3, I created a Streamlit App that allows the user to interact with and optimize three different machine learning models using input data. The building of this app allowed me to understand the importance of ML model optimization, as I realized that both minor and major tweaks can drastically improve and accelerate real-life applications of machine learning models. This app also builds upon previous Python modules such as pandas and seaborn, and learning how to integrate these modules with Streamlit proved to be challenging, but very helpful in my data visualization and expression journey.

For my final project in my Introduction to Data Science Class, I created and uploaded a Streamlit app that allows the user to upload their dataset, handle missing values and categorical variables, and interact with/optimize 3 different unsupervised machine learning models. In creating this app, I learned that even tiny adjustments of hyperparameters can have a drastic impact on the performance of these machine learning models and that the complexity of certain datasets can either dampen or boost the predictability of certain models. Furthermore, I researched the interaction between Streamlit and Matplotlib, and although the syntax required to integrate these two modules was challenging to discover, it ultimately allowed me to produce a cohesive Streamlit app that I hope users will get a lot of benefit out of.
