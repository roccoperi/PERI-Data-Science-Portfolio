# Data Science Portfolio - Rocco Peri
This Portfolio is a compilation of my previous and future Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done/will do for academic and personal purposes. I hope that through the projects presented on this page, my personal interests and passions shine through. Over this semester, I plan on adding to the projects with links to their specific repositories, in which I will use images and code to properly convey the work done throughout my last semester at Notre Dame. 

## Projects

In this project, I utilized the NetHealth Data Set to determine whether racially homophilous relationships decrease or increase over time. Using log-likelihood regressions and variation in basic descriptive summary statistics of networks, I determined that for some races, students at Notre Dame actively maintain and seek out same-race relationships more often than different-race relationships.

In this project, I used sentiment analysis of Reddit posts of certain stock tickers to determine whether the average daily positive and negative sentiment scores of that stock on each day over a year accurately predicted whether the price of the stock increased or decreased. Using RStudio, 3 different sentiment packages, and web scraping with pushshift API, I came to many conclusions regarding the validity of sentiment analysis and where to move forward after this project.

In this project for Portfolio Update 1, I created a Streamlit app in which the user filters a species of penguin from the Palmer Penguins Dataset and the app produces the summary statistics of the species of penguin.
