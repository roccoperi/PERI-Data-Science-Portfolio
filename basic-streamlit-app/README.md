# This is a basic Streamlit app which imports data from the Palmer Penguins Dataset, allows the user to filter the penguins by species, and then the app calculates basic summary statistics of the penguin species. 
To run the app on a local server, you have to run the code 
  streamlit run ./basic_streamlit_app/main.py 
in VS Studio after downloading all of the files in the basic-streamlit-app folder.
